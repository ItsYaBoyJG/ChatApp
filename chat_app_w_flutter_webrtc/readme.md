# A Video Chat Mobile Application

- This version uses the [Flutter-WebRTC](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_webrtc) package.
- I used the example WebRTC server to test P2P. Setup for this can be found [here](https://github.com/flutter-webrtc/flutter-webrtc-server).

## Features
  - Video chat
  - In-app text messaging
    - Uses the Flutter Firebase [Chat Core](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_firebase_chat_core).
    - Relies on Firebase streams to send and receive messages.
    - Users can choose between messages those on their in-app friends list and active app users.





## Upcoming Features
  - A map feature that will allow you to see where your friends are.
  - A feature that will allow sending and receiving photos or videos between friends.
